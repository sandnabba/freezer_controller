# 1.8" ST7735R TFT LCD Display

There seems to be quite a lot of different displays using this chip, all with different break out boards.
Mine had the following pins, and this is how I connected it:

| Display | Pi |
|:-------:|:--:|
|   Led   |  9 |
|   SCK   |    |
|   SDA   |    |
|   A0    |    |
|   Reset |    |
|   CS    |    |
|   GND   | GND |
|   VCC   | 3.3v|
